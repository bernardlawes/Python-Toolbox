## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside

This toolbox includes examples and utilities covering:

### ðŸ“¦ Core Themes

- ðŸ§  **AI & Computer Vision Utilities**
  - Image pipelines with OpenCV (e.g. grayscale, blur, Canny, thresholding)
  - Webcam input processors
  - Frame analysis and manipulation

- ðŸ§± **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
  - Reusable class structures for image processing
  - Composable pipelines using method maps and lambdas
  - Encapsulation of CLI argument handling and UI logic

- ðŸ§ª **Code Efficiency & Pythonic Design**
  - Functional design with `lambda`, `partial`, and map-based control flow
  - Clean CLI interfaces using `argparse`
  - Smart tree-building scripts and system utilities

- ðŸ§¹ **Project Automation**
  - Directory tree visualizers
  - File utilities and I/O helpers

## ðŸ§° Example Use Cases

- Process webcam frames through a customizable filter pipeline:

  python main.py --steps gray blur canny
